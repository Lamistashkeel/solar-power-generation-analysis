# Solar Power Generation Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes solar power generation data using Python to understand energy production behavior, variability, and trends over time. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from clean solar generation data through analysis and visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset contains recorded solar power generation values along with time-based information. It is used to study production patterns, peak generation periods, and overall performance of solar energy systems.

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis of solar power generation
- Time-based trend analysis
- Visualization of power output patterns
- Identification of peak and low generation periods

## Key Insights
- Solar power generation follows clear daily patterns influenced by sunlight availability.
- Peak generation occurs during daytime hours, with reduced or zero output at night.
- Variations in output highlight the impact of environmental and temporal factors.
